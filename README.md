This is one of my first projects in learning Python for Data Analysis Application

Generally, I just web scraped a simple Wikipedia Table from the topic "List of Largest Wastewater Treatment Plants"
I chose this topic since my educational background is from environmental engineering specializing in wastewater treatment processes.

So here, I was able to gather the plant name, location, year established, and some basic dimensions for its capacity to treat wastewater.
I would like to showcase some basic knowledge in utilizing Python (for data gathering, data understanding, and cleaning) followed by some visualizations
using Python (for basic 2D Charts) and R language (for geospatial visualization). So I put additional data by geocoding the information of only the City and Country to be 
able to produce maps which is also available using Python but I prefer to use R since that is where I am comfortable to execute sourcecode in geospatial visualizations.

From my basic understanding, the fundamentals of data science involves the steps of gathering, analyzing, cleaning, visualization, and finally interpretation to make
the data gathered meaningful.
